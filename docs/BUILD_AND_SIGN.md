# Building and Code Signing

## Building the app

- **Renderer (Vite):** `npm run build:renderer`
- **Full app (no signing):** `npm run build:win` (Windows), `npm run build:mac`, `npm run build:linux`
- **All platforms:** `npm run build:all`

Output goes to `dist/` (installer and unpacked artifacts).

## Windows code signing (avoid “Unknown publisher” warnings)

To sign the Windows executable so users don’t see SmartScreen / “Windows protected your PC”:

1. **Obtain a code signing certificate**
   - **EV (recommended):** from a CA (DigiCert, Sectigo, etc.). Often requires hardware token; gives immediate SmartScreen reputation.
   - **Standard (OV):** cheaper; SmartScreen reputation builds over time.

2. **Export to PFX** (if you have a cert in Windows Certificate Store)
   - `certmgr.msc` → Personal → Certificates → your code signing cert → Right‑click → All Tasks → Export.
   - Export private key, format **PFX**, set a password.

3. **Configure electron-builder with env vars**

   | Variable | Description |
   |--------|--------------|
   | `WIN_CSC_LINK` | Path to your `.pfx` file (or base64 of the file for CI) |
   | `WIN_CSC_KEY_PASSWORD` | Password for the PFX |
   | `WIN_CSC_SUBJECT_NAME` | Subject name of the cert (e.g. `"CN=Your Name"`); optional if only one cert in PFX |

   Example (PowerShell, local):

   ```powershell
   $env:WIN_CSC_LINK = "C:\path\to\your-cert.pfx"
   $env:WIN_CSC_KEY_PASSWORD = "YourPfxPassword"
   npm run build:win
   ```

4. **CI (GitHub Actions)**
   Add the PFX as a base64 secret and its password; the release workflow passes them to electron-builder. See [electron-builder code signing](https://www.electron.build/code-signing).

If these env vars are **not** set, the build still runs but the exe is **unsigned**; users may see SmartScreen or “Unknown publisher”.

## macOS signing and notarization

You need an Apple Developer account ($99/year) and a **Developer ID Application** certificate.

1. Export the certificate with its private key from Keychain Access as a `.p12` with a password.
2. Create an app-specific password at appleid.apple.com.
3. Add the secrets below. electron-builder signs with the certificate and notarizes automatically when the Apple ID secrets are present.

## Release secrets (repository › Settings › Secrets and variables › Actions)

| Secret | Used for |
|---|---|
| `MAC_CSC_LINK` | base64 of the Developer ID Application `.p12` (`base64 -i cert.p12 \| pbcopy`) |
| `MAC_CSC_KEY_PASSWORD` | password of that `.p12` |
| `APPLE_ID` | Apple ID email used for notarization |
| `APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD` | app-specific password for that Apple ID |
| `APPLE_TEAM_ID` | your 10-character team ID |
| `WIN_CSC_LINK` | base64 of the Windows code-signing `.pfx` |
| `WIN_CSC_KEY_PASSWORD` | password of that `.pfx` |

All are optional: missing secrets mean an unsigned build for that platform, not a failed one.

## Clean machine / portable testing

After building:

1. Copy the installer (e.g. `dist/Impulse-IDE-Setup-2.0.0-beta.1.exe`) to a clean machine or VM.
2. Install and run. Confirm: open folder, compile, upload, serial monitor, AI panel.
3. Check that user data (sketches, memory, settings) lives under the correct app data folder (e.g. `%APPDATA%\Impulse IDE` on Windows when built with this productName).

## No CDN dependency (packaged app)

The packaged app does **not** rely on any CDN:

- **CodeMirror:** Bundled by Vite from `node_modules/codemirror`.
- **Fonts:** Inter and JetBrains Mono come from `@fontsource-variable/*`; Vite copies them into `dist-renderer/assets/`.
- **CSP:** `default-src 'self'`; fonts load only from the app itself (see `Content-Security-Policy` in `src/main/main.js`). Network access is limited to AI providers and update checks from the main process.
